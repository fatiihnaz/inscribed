## Philosophy

A few principles shape almost every decision in this codebase. Keep them in mind
and most "where should this go?" questions answer themselves.

- **Vendor-neutral core.** The core depends on no backend and no auth library.
  Anything backend- or auth-specific goes behind an injection seam with a default
  in `src/defaults/`. If you find yourself importing a vendor SDK into `src/lib/`
  or `src/components/`, stop; it belongs behind a seam.
- **The RSC boundary is sacred.** Functions can't be serialized across the React
  Server → Client boundary. Config objects that cross it (props) must stay
  serializable; anything holding functions (transport, service token) is resolved
  at the use site on each side. Breaking this throws
  _"Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components"_ at runtime.
- **Server-only vs client-only is explicit.** Client code lives behind the
  `inscribed` entry's `"use client"` boundary; server code lives under
  `inscribed/server` and `inscribed/page`. Never import server modules from client code.
- **JavaScript + JSDoc, not TypeScript source.** We author `.js`/`.jsx` with JSDoc
  type annotations and emit `.d.ts` from them. There is no `.ts` source.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **npm** (the repo uses `package-lock.json`)

The package is ESM-only (`"type": "module"`).

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fatiihnaz/inscribed.git
cd inscribed
npm install
npm run build    # produce dist/
npm test         # run the unit suite
```

To iterate against a real app, use `npm run dev` (tsup in watch mode) and link the
package into a consuming Next.js project (`npm link`, a workspace, or a local
`file:` dependency).

## Project layout

```
src/
  index.js              # `inscribed` (client entry, "use client" lives here)
  components/           # React components (EditableRegion, drawer UI, ...)
  hooks/                # client hooks (useCmsContent, useCollection, ...)
  lib/                  # framework-agnostic logic + JSDoc typedefs
    config.js           #   createCmsConfig (serializable config)
    transport.js        #   CmsTransport contract (typedef only)
    service-token.js    #   ServiceTokenProvider contract
    auth.js             #   CmsAuthAdapter contract
    schemas.js          #   backend request/response typedefs
    store.js            #   external store (per-slice subscriptions)
  defaults/             # default seam implementations
    transport.js        #   createRestTransport (the /cms/* REST adapter)
    service-token.js    #   noServiceToken
    auth.js             #   publicAuth (read-only)
  server/               # SERVER ONLY
    get-content.js      #   `inscribed/server` entry
    actions.js          #   `inscribed/actions` entry ("use server")
    cms-page.jsx        #   `inscribed/page` entry (createCmsPage)
    discover.js         #   AST manifest discovery
  cli/
    sync.js             #   `cms-sync` binary
  tests/                # Vitest specs + discovery fixtures & snapshots
```

Tests live under `src/tests/` as `*.test.js` (fixtures in `src/tests/__fixtures__/`).

## Build

The build is [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) (esbuild). Entry points are defined
in `tsup.config.js` and mirror the `exports` map in `package.json`:

| Entry | Source | Published as |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| `index`    | `src/index.js`            | `inscribed` |
| `server`   | `src/server/get-content.js` | `inscribed/server` |
| `actions`  | `src/server/actions.js`   | `inscribed/actions` |
| `page`     | `src/server/cms-page.jsx` | `inscribed/page` |
| `cli-sync` | `src/cli/sync.js`         | `cms-sync` bin |

```bash
npm run build      # one-off build → dist/
npm run dev        # watch mode
```

### Directive caveats (important)

tsup/esbuild **drops inner-file `"use client"` / `"use server"` directives** when
bundling; only the **entry file's top-level directive survives**. Consequences:

- `src/index.js` must keep its top-level `"use client"`. Every transitive `.jsx`
  it bundles becomes part of one Client Component bundle.
- `src/server/actions.js` must keep its top-level `"use server"` so Next.js treats
  each export as a Server Action.
- A directive only survives across a **package entry boundary**. This is why, for
  example, `createCmsPage` takes `Provider` and `onAfterSave` as options instead
  of importing them: importing a `"use client"` provider or `"use server"` action
  into the server entry would strip its directive during bundling.

`react`, `react-dom`, `next`, and the native `oxc-parser` are marked
`external` so they aren't bundled (tsup can't bundle the platform binary; it's
resolved from the consumer's `node_modules` at runtime).

## Type declarations

`.d.ts` files are generated from JSDoc by tsup (`dts: true`), configured via
`tsconfig.json` (`allowJs`, `declaration`, `emitDeclarationOnly`). There is no
hand-written TypeScript.

- Annotate public API with accurate JSDoc, since it _is_ the published type surface.
- Use `@typedef`, `@param`, `@returns`, and `@import { X } from "..."` for shared
  shapes. `src/lib/schemas.js` holds the backend request/response typedefs;
  reference them rather than redefining shapes inline.
- `checkJs` is currently off, but write JSDoc as if it were on; incorrect
  annotations ship as incorrect types.

## Testing

Tests run on [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) in a Node environment (no DOM yet;
the current suite covers pure logic and the transport contract).

```bash
npm test           # run once
npm run test:watch # watch mode
```

- Place tests under `src/tests/` as `*.test.js`.
- Keep tests in the Node environment unless you're testing a component/hook, in
  which case add an `environment: "jsdom"` override for that file.
- Cover new `lib/` logic and any new `CmsTransport` method against the contract.

## Code style & conventions

- **Match the surrounding code.** Mirror existing naming, comment density, and
  idioms in the file you're editing.
- **Comments explain _why_, not _what_.** The codebase favours substantial
  comments on non-obvious decisions (the RSC boundary, cache invalidation, store
  subscriptions). Preserve and extend that style; don't strip context.
- **Server/client hygiene.** Never import `inscribed/server`, `inscribed/page`, or any
  `src/server/**` module from client code, and vice versa. Keep browser-only
  types out of `src/lib/config.js` (it's read on both sides).
- **No functions across the RSC boundary.** Anything that becomes a prop on a
  Client Component must be serializable. Resolve function-bearing seams at the use
  site.
- **Discovery metadata must be static literals.** `blockType`, `defaultValue`,
  and `itemSchema` are read by the AST scanner, so it can't evaluate variables or
  imports.

## Working with the seams

Three injection seams keep the core vendor-neutral. Each is a contract in
`src/lib/` with a default in `src/defaults/`:

| Seam | Contract (`src/lib/`) | Default (`src/defaults/`) |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Transport | `transport.js` (`CmsTransport`) | `transport.js` (`createRestTransport`) |
| Service token | `service-token.js` | `service-token.js` (`noServiceToken`) |
| Auth adapter | `auth.js` (`CmsAuthAdapter`) | `auth.js` (`publicAuth`) |

When you add a feature that needs to talk to a backend, route it through the
transport; don't `fetch` directly from a component or hook. The REST adapter in
`defaults/transport.js` is the **only** place that knows concrete endpoint shapes,
headers (`X-CMS-Client-Id`), and `CmsApiError` mapping.

## Common tasks

### Add a `CmsTransport` method

1. Add the method signature to the `CmsTransport` typedef in `src/lib/transport.js`.
2. Implement it in `src/defaults/transport.js` (the REST adapter).
3. Call it from the relevant hook/component/server helper via `config.transport`.
4. Add a contract test in `src/tests/transport.test.js`.

Keep the method's options shape consistent: `(…, opts?)` where `opts` is
`{ accessToken?, cache?, signal? }`.

### Add a block type

1. Extend the `BlockType` union and document its value shape in
   `src/lib/schemas.js`.
2. Teach `<EditableRegion>` (and discovery in `src/server/discover.js`) to render
   and recognise it.
3. Add the editor UI in the admin drawer components.

## Commit conventions

We use **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** with small,
atomic commits: one logical change per commit, with a clean message.

```
<type>: <imperative summary>

feat:     a new capability
fix:      a bug fix
refactor: behaviour-preserving change
docs:     documentation only
test:     tests only
chore:    tooling / housekeeping
```

**Breaking changes (pre-1.0):** the project is `0.x` and may break compatibility
between minor versions. When a change is breaking, add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
describing the break and the migration:

```
feat: rename CmsTransport.fetchPage to getContent

BREAKING CHANGE: custom transports must rename `fetchPage` to `getContent`.
```

Prefer several focused commits over one large mixed commit. Don't bundle a refactor
with a feature.

## Pull requests

1. Branch off `main`.
2. Keep the PR focused; split unrelated changes.
3. Ensure `npm run build` and `npm test` both pass.
4. Update JSDoc/types and the README when you change public API.
5. Describe the change and call out any breaking change explicitly.

## Releasing

`prepublishOnly` runs the build, and only `dist`, `LICENSE`, and `COPYING` are
published (see `files` in `package.json`). Releases bump the version per semver
(pre-1.0: breaking changes may land in minor bumps; see commit conventions).
