/**
 * Allowed values for `BlockResponse.blockType`.
 *
 * Value shapes per type:
 *   - Text / RichText : string
 *   - Image           : { src: string, alt: string }
 *   - Link            : { href: string, label: string }
 *   - Date            : ISO 8601 string, e.g. "2026-08-15T18:00:00.000Z". Empty string when unset.
 *   - List            : Array of plain objects shaped by the manifest's `itemSchema`
 *                       (each object's keys map to leaf block types). The whole
 *                       list shares one `version` - all reorder/add/remove/edit
 *                       operations save atomically.
 *   - Collection      : Read-only binding to the backend's `/cms/collections/{key}` API.
 *                       `value` carries `{ collection: string, slug?: string }`;
 *                       resolved items are fetched separately by the SDK and
 *                       handed to consumer render-props (`<CollectionRegion>` /
 *                       `<CollectionItem>`). No inline editing - writes happen
 *                       in the collection's own admin surface (e.g. team leader
 *                       portal). CMS just surfaces the data here.

 *   published version and `draftValue` carries the draft. Backend
 *   auto-cleans (sends `null`) when the two would otherwise be equal,
 *   so any non-null `draftValue` is guaranteed to differ from `value`.
 *   Public payloads omit / null this field.
 * @property {string} [_slug]
 *   Client-side hint stamped by the SDK after fetch so the save layer
 *   knows which slug to PUT each block back to. Not part of the wire
